        <p>Full-Stack Web Developer with Experience in Front-End and Back-End Technologies
            As a web developer with experience in a wide range of technologies, I specialize in creating robust and
            efficient web applications that combine functionality and intuitive design. My mastery of languages ​​and
            tools such as JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP, SASS, and Node.js allows me to develop bespoke solutions that
            adapt to the specific needs of each project.

            In the field of databases, I have a solid background in database management and optimization, ensuring that
            applications are not only fast, but also secure and scalable. My approach to full-stack development allows
            me to understand and work on all layers of an application, from the user interface to server logic and data
            management.

            My commitment is to create digital experiences that not only meet technical requirements, but also offer a
            fluid and engaging user experience.
